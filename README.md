The zip file houses all the source code used to create shokam's trojan horse.  
`Shokam Dating Sim.exe` runs a dating sim made with the [Potato framework](https://github.com/WAP-Industries/Potato).  
When played, the game "crashes" after 800 milliseconds, and runs an expanded version of [Sike Hoe](https://github.com/WAP-Industries/sike-hoe).
